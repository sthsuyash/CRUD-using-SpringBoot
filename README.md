## RESTful API

In today's modern web development, RESTful APIs have become a cornerstone for building scalable, efficient and
maintainable web applications. In the world of computers and the internet, applications communicate with each other
using a set of rules. RESTful APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are act as intermediaries between different
software applications (client and server), allowing them to communicate and share data with each other over the
internet.

### Note

- The `@Service` annotation is used to indicate that a class is a service component in the Spring application context.
- The `@Component` annotation is a generic stereotype annotation used to indicate that a class is a Spring component.
  Components annotated with @Component are candidates for auto-detection when using Spring's component scanning feature.
- The `@Autowired` annotation is used to automatically inject dependencies into Spring-managed beans. When Spring
  encounters a bean annotated with @Autowired, it looks for other beans in the application context that match the type
  of the dependency and injects it.
- The `@Slf4j` annotation is not a standard Spring annotation but rather a Lombok annotation used for logging.
